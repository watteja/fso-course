# Full stack open coursework

This repository contains all the exercises submitted for the Full stack open course, collected in a single place.

Note that many of the exercises (e.g. those in parts 3, 10, 11, 12, and 13) require the code to be located in a separate repo to function or deploy properly. For part 11 in particular, it's no longer possible to verify GitHub logs related to the CI/CD pipelines required by the exercises.
