# Bloglist app frontend (with Redux)

The starting point of this Bloglist app frontend is the last version from part 5 of the course.

To make it work, first start the backend from part 4 (by executing `npm run dev`, for example), then start this frontend with `npm run dev`.

To run the tests, execute `npm run test`.

To check for linting errors, execute `npm run lint`.
